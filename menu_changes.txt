	Open the file Templates/Main.dwt

              Before each of the lines there is a comment explaining what 
              changes can be made - here are some examples: 

              Locate mymenu.mainmenuitemsize(135,16) - defines the width and 
              height in pixels of a menu item in the main menu. (The first one 
              to appear). 
              Locate mymenu.submenuitemsize(152,16) - defines the width and 
              height in pixels of the sub menu items.

              Locate mymenu.submenuplacing(0,0) - defines the position of the 
              sub menus in relation to the main menu.the first number will move 
              the sub menus more to the left, and the second number will move 
              the sub menus down. If the second number is negative it will 
              move the sub menus up. 

              Locate 
              mymenu.mainborderimages("images/greypixel.gif","images/greypixel.gif","images/clearpixel.gif","images/greypixel.gif")
              mymenu.mainbordercorners("images/greypixel.gif","images/greypixel.gif","images/greypixel.gif","images/greypixel.gif")
			 - use this function if you want to define a graphical border for 
              the main menu - here we've given the menu items a grey border.The images are, in order, those which 
              are to the left, right, top and bottom of the main menu and the respective corners.

              
	 		  Locate
			  mymenu.subborderimages("images/greypixel.gif","images/greypixel.gif","images/greypixel.gif","images/greypixel.gif")
              mymenu.subbordercorners("images/greypixel.gif","images/greypixel.gif","images/greypixel.gif","images/greypixel.gif")
              - as mainborderimages, but for all submenus so you can define a 
              different style for sub menus. If you wish to have the same style, 
              simply define the same images. Here we've used a grey border.
 
              Locate mymenu.mainborderdimensions(1,1,1) - These are the 
              dimensions of the main menu borders. The first parameter is the 
              left width, the second the right width, and the third the height 
              at both top and bottom. If you did wish the top and bottom to have 
              different heights, you can of course pad with rows of transparent 
              pixels.
              Locate mymenu.subborderdimensions(1,1,1) - As above but for all 
              sub menus.

              Locate mymenu.mainmenucolor("#F7F7F4") - The color of the main 
              menu cells. Any valid HTML color is ok. 
              Locate mymenu.submenucolor("#F7F7F4") - The color of the sub menu 
              cells. 

	          Locate mymenu.netscapeadjust(3,3) - Unfortunately Netscape 4.7 
              does not behave quite so well with DHTML. If you find that the 
              text in the menu items is vertically aligned "top" in NN 4.7, then 
              adjusting these numbers will nudge it down by that number of 
              pixels. The first number is for the main menus, and the second for 
              the sub menus. 

	 Locate mymenu.definemainspacer("images/greypixel.gif",1)
	 - The graphic that goes between menu items in the main menu. If you do not wish 
              to define one then simply leave this line blank. 
              mymenu.definesubspacer("images/greypixel.gif",1)
 	 - As above but for sub menus.

    Locate
    	mymenu.addMenu("home","O HOME", "default.asp")
    	mymenu.addMenu("main","O MAIN", "#")

		/* <%
		' Please note, the following line of code is used to automatically create the links for the product sections
		' If you do not want to use this feature, please delete this line of code in your Main.dwt template
		' along with the corresponding section below.
		%> */
		mymenu.addMenu("products","O PRODUCTS", "categories.php")

		mymenu.addMenu("help","O HELP", "#")
		mymenu.addMenu("affiliates","O AFFILIATES", "affiliate.php")
		mymenu.addMenu("search","O SEARCH", "search.php")
		mymenu.addMenu("checkout","O CHECKOUT", "cart.php")
		// This line is required after the main menu is defined.
		mymenu.showMainMenu()

	This where you define you main menu items and their links. The order is category eg "main", name to appear eg. "O MAIN", link eg."default.asp
	The links to products and categories are generated automatically from the ones you add in your online admin section.
		
		Locate
		// Define the sub menus
		mymenu.addSubMenu("main", "", "O ABOUT US", "about.php")
		mymenu.addSubMenu("main", "", "O HELP", "help.php")
		mymenu.addSubMenu("main", "", "O SERVICES", "services.php")
		mymenu.addSubMenu("main", "", "O CONTACT", "contact.php")
		mymenu.addSubMenu("main", "", "O EMAIL", "mailto:#")
		
	These are the sub-menu choices, notice that we use the same category name "main" so that they "pop-out" from the option Main
		
		Locate
		mymenu.addSubMenu("help", "faq", "O FAQ", "#")
		mymenu.addSubMenu("help", "tutorials", "O TUTORIALS", "#")

		mymenu.addSubMenu("faq", "", "O COMPATIBILITY", "#")
		mymenu.addSubMenu("faq", "", "O DHTML MENUS", "#")
		mymenu.addSubMenu("faq", "", "O DHTML MENUS", "#")
		mymenu.addSubMenu("faq", "", "O GRAPHICS", "#")
		mymenu.addSubMenu("faq", "", "O LICENSE", "#")


		mymenu.addSubMenu("tutorials", "", "O TEMPLATE SET UP", "#")
		mymenu.addSubMenu("tutorials", "", "O INCLUDE PAGES", "#")
		mymenu.addSubMenu("tutorials", "navigation", "O NAVIGATION", "#")

		mymenu.addSubMenu("navigation", "", "O FP NAVIGATION", "#")
		mymenu.addSubMenu("navigation", "", "O DW NAVIGATION", "#")
		mymenu.addSubMenu("navigation", "", "O GL NAVIGATION", "#")
		
	These are the submenus that pop-out from the HELP button on the menu and shows how to have second and third level submenus
	To see how it works - look at this example:
		mymenu.addSubMenu("help", "tutorials", "O TUTORIALS", "#")
	This creates a pop-out entitled O TUTORIALS from the HELP button, it also defines a new submenu ie "tutorials"
	This mean we can have another pop-out level under the name "tutorials" eg.
		mymenu.addSubMenu("tutorials", "navigation", "O NAVIGATION", "#")
	This creates a pop-out entitled O NAVIGATION from the TUTORIALS button, it also defines a new submenu ie "navigation"
	The last set of pop-outs are:
		mymenu.addSubMenu("navigation", "", "O FP NAVIGATION", "#")
		mymenu.addSubMenu("navigation", "", "O DW NAVIGATION", "#")
		mymenu.addSubMenu("navigation", "", "O GL NAVIGATION", "#")
	Notice there are no submenus defined ie "",
	


    To change the colour of the text links, you'll need to open the file styles.css. Change the hex
	values to the ones that best suit your site. The CSS also governs the Uppercase lettering although this is ignored by NN4.7x
		 
	NOTES:
	There is nothing in the .js file that needs editing
	The menu will only function correctly in .asp pages
	You must have the files clearpixel.gif, popouttext.js and styles.css in the root of your web, where your main page resides.
	You can link to another site by using a full URL - for example "http://www.ecommercetemplates.com/".
	If you want to make the link open in a new window, for example mymenu.addSubMenu("help", "", "<b>DHTML</b>", 'http://www.ecommercetemplates.com/help/menus.asp" target="_blank')
	Be careful with the punctuation here
	
	There is a FAQ section on our site here http://www.ecommercetemplates.com/help/menus.asp
