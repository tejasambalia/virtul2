Licensing FAQ:

Q: Can I make changes to the color, graphics and layout of the template?
A: Yes - you can change the template to suit your needs within your HTML editor. Graphics changes require a graphics editor to do so.

Q: I have three Web sites and want them all to look exactly the same. Can I use my template on all three?
A: Yes - as long as the sites all belong to the person who purchased the template - it can be used as many times as necessary.

Q: I have two clients that would like to use a template that I purchased from you as the design for their own sites. Can I customize this template for their use?.
A: Each of your clients must first purchase (or you may purchase for them) a copy of the template from us and then you may customize it for them as needed. To use your own copy of the template to create a website for your client is a violation of the licensing agreement and can be prosecuted accordingly.

Q: Can I resell your templates from my Web site?
A: We have an affiliate program that allows web site owners to sell our templates from their site and earn commissions on those sale. The only manner in which you may legally resell our products is by joining our affiliate program.

Q: Can I post thumbnails of your templates in my portfolio for my clients to select from?
A: No. Our products are copyright protected materials and using them as part of your portfolio is a direct violation of that copyright. You may link to our site to allow your clients to purchase a template - but you cannot behave in any manner indicating the template is of your own design unless you purchase another template specifically for each client on your own.
